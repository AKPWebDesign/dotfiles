# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. I don't trust them not to destroy my computer, and you shouldn't either.

### Disclaimer
No, seriously. I'm not responsible if your computer bursts into flames or otherwise becomes unusable
after using anything from these dotfiles.

### Info
I created these on my work MacBook Pro and cobbled pieces together on multiple MacBook Pros (and Windows machines) over the years.
They may be broken or unsuitable for any other machines. Feel free to help me fix that though!
